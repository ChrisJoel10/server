You know, a lot of people ask me, "Michael, why is Dunder Mifflin the best place to work?" And I tell them, it's like a family here. No, really, we are like one big, happy, dysfunctional family. We've got it all – the cool uncle (that's me!), the know-it-all sister (Angela), the funny cousin (Dwight), and the adorable nephew you want to spoil (Jim). We sell paper, but it's not just paper; it's the pages of your life. Your love letters, your resumes, maybe even your divorce papers. But let's not focus on the negatives!\r\n\r\nYou see, here at Dunder Mifflin, we don't just sell paper and office supplies, we sell dreams and freedom wrapped in Quabity First paper. We have Pretzel Day, Diversity Day, and don't even get me started on the Dundies! It's not just an award show; it's a celebration of each unique individual in this office. And let's not forget the parties! Our Party Planning Committee works tirelessly to make sure we have the most exciting, most extravagant parties you've ever seen in an office setting. So come on down to Dunder Mifflin Scranton, where the coffee's hot but the people are hotter!		U	public	f	why-dunder-mifflin-is-the-place-to-work	\N	0	49	\N	2

You see, people think sales is just about numbers and charts, but it's not. It's about forming a connection, a bond, a spiritual link if you will. When I walk into a room, I don't see customers; I see future friends. You've got to woo them, like you're Jim and they're Pam, except you're selling paper, not stealing glances across the room.\r\n\r\nNow, let's talk technique. The Michael Scott sales technique is as easy as ABCDE. A – Always, B – Be, C – Closing, D – Deals, E – Efficiently. First, you flatter them. Compliment their office, their tie, their teeth, whatever. Then, you hit them with the facts – Dunder Mifflin's paper is the best. Finally, seal the deal with a joke, because everyone likes to laugh. So next time you're in a sales pitch, just remember, ABCDE, and you'll do just fine.		U	public	f	the-art-of-the-perfect-sales-pitch	\N	0	49	\N	2

Office romance, it's a beautiful thing, isn't it? It spices up your workday, keeps you looking forward to that 9 to 5 grind, and let's face it, we've all been there. I mean, who could forget the legendary love story of Jim and Pam? It's like Romeo and Juliet, but with fewer feuds and more fax machines.\r\n\r\nNow, I get it, HR manuals will tell you to steer clear of office romances. Pssh, rules. What they don't tell you is that love, like paper, is essential for the office ecosystem. So go ahead, flirt a little at the water cooler, leave a sweet note on your crush's desk, but remember, keep it respectful and professional. Just like me!

Michael Scott here to talk about the most anticipated event of the year at Dunder Mifflin: The Office Olympics! That's right, an event where we set aside our work and compete in the most epic games you can imagine. I'm talking Flonkerton, chair races, and even coffee cup stacking!\r\n\r\nLet me tell you, the Office Olympics isn't just about winning; it's about unity, teamwork, and making sure Toby doesn't win anything because, let's be honest, he's from HR. So, come one, come all, let's make Dunder Mifflin Scranton the true Olympic Village of the paper industry!		U	public	f	the-office-olympics	\N	0	49	\N	2

Michael Scott here with some tips and tricks to make it through those seemingly endless conference room gatherings. Rule number one: always sit close to the snacks. A well-fed employee is a happy employee. Rule number two: Laugh at your boss's jokes. Even if they're not funny. Especially if they're not funny.\r\n\r\nAnd here's my golden rule: Always, always bring an idea to the table. It doesn't have to be a good idea. In fact, it's better if it's a bad idea because then everyone will spend time talking about how bad it is and forget that they're stuck in a meeting. You're welcome!

Michael Scott here, and today I'm going to share the secret to my award-winning chili. You see, the trick is to undercook the onions. Everybody is going to get to know each other in the pot. I'm serious about this stuff. You have your meat, you have your beans, and you have your spices, but what brings them together? The onions. Undercooked, so they're still a bit crunchy.\r\n\r\nNow, I usually make a huge pot of this for our annual Dunder Mifflin Chili Cook-off. It's a hit, even if I do sometimes spill it.

Rule number one: never take someone else's lunch. It's a cardinal sin that disrupts the office ecosystem and creates unnecessary tension among coworkers.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you find yourself eyeing Dwight's sandwich, well, all bets are off. In fact, the break room is the ideal setting for some harmless pranks and playful banter. Just remember to keep it civil; after all, we're all in this together.

Alliances form, conflicts arise, and before you know it, you're caught in a never-ending cycle of drama. The key to survival is staying neutral and keeping your nose out of other people's business. Trust me, it's a lifesaver.\r\n\r\nOf course, there are exceptions to this rule, especially when it involves defending your personal workspace. If a certain beet-farming coworker decides to encroach on your territory, sometimes a little conflict is necessary. Just make sure to choose your battles wisely.

Whether it's a casual game during lunch or a more organized event, the competition can get fierce. My go-to strategy? Make sure Dwight is guarding you. It's like having a free pass to the hoop.\r\n\r\nHowever, while winning is fun, the real joy comes from the camaraderie and teamwork. There's nothing like a good game of basketball to bring the office together and create some lasting memories. Just be sure to keep it friendly; after all, you'll all be back at your desks come Monday morning.		U	public	f	how-to-win-at-office-basketball	\N	0	18	\N	3

On one hand, you spend so much time with your colleagues that it's almost natural for relationships to form. On the other hand, there are HR policies, awkwardness, and potential conflicts of interest. My advice? Keep it discreet, keep it professional, and don't, under any circumstances, announce it via a rooftop BBQ.\r\n\r\nWhat worked for Pam and me was maintaining a sense of friendship and camaraderie before anything else. We also made sure to keep things quiet until we were sure about our feelings. The office can be a wonderful place to meet your soulmate, but it's also a place where you have to work, so tread carefully.		U	public	f	the-subtleties-of-office-romance	\N	0	18	\N	3

While Michael's hosting can be cringe-worthy, the Dundies are also an opportunity for the office to come together and celebrate... something. The key to enjoying the night is to expect the unexpected and to have a sense of humor about it all.\r\n\r\nFor instance, when you get an award for 'Whitest Sneakers,' don't think of it as a weird, somewhat random recognition. Think of it as a badge of honor that you will carry with you—until next year's Dundies, at least. It's all about perspective.		U	public	f	surviving-the-annual-dundies	\N	0	18	\N	3

Terms like "business casual," "casual Friday," and "semi-formal" leave a lot of room for interpretation. Generally, you can't go wrong with a simple shirt and tie. But whatever you do, avoid dressing like you're going to a Renaissance fair.\r\n\r\nHowever, some coworkers (yes, Dwight, I'm talking about you) have their own unique interpretation of what's acceptable. Mustard-colored shirts and ill-fitting suits are just the tip of the iceberg. So, find your comfort zone within the boundaries of office appropriateness, and you'll be just fine.

Whether it's Secret Santa, a birthday, or another celebration, the stakes are surprisingly high. A good gift can make someone's day, but a bad gift can be a source of endless office jokes. My advice? Keep it simple and thoughtful. A personalized mug or a gift card to a favorite restaurant is always a safe bet.\r\n\r\nBut if you're in the mood for some mischief, then why not a bag full of beets for Dwight? The key is to know your audience. A prank gift for Dwight is fun because I know he can take a joke. But for someone else, I'd stick to something a little more traditional.

Sometimes they're a blast, and other times they can be, well, a bit dull. The key to enjoying any office party is to find the fun wherever you can. Maybe it's in a silly game, or perhaps it's the free food. Either way, make the most of it.\r\n\r\nAnd if you find yourself at a particularly uneventful gathering, you can always create your own fun. Like starting a betting pool on when Dwight will finally realize his karaoke machine has been unplugged. Trust me, it'll be the highlight of the night.

For years, Scranton has been that family for me. But sometimes, even in the most tight-knit of families, you reach a point where you need to step back and reassess. For me, that time has come, triggered by something deeply personal—unrequited love.\r\n\r\nWe all have that one coworker who becomes more than just a colleague. For me, that was Pam. When you spend so many hours working alongside someone, sharing jokes, moments, and even silent glances, it's easy to blur the lines. But life isn't a fairy tale, and not all stories have happy endings. I put my heart on the line, and it didn't work out the way I'd hoped. It's a tough pill to swallow, and it's made staying in Scranton more painful than I could've imagined.\r\n\r\nSo, after a lot of soul-searching, I've decided to transfer to a different branch. It's not a decision I've taken lightly. Leaving means saying goodbye to people who've become more than just coworkers—they're friends, mentors, and part of my extended family. But sometimes, a fresh start is necessary, a way to heal and grow away from the place that's seen your highest highs and lowest lows.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what Stamford holds for me. New faces, new challenges, and hopefully, new opportunities to find happiness and a sense of peace. I'll always be grateful for my time in Scranton, for the lessons I've learned, and the memories I've created. It's a chapter of my life that I'll cherish, even if it's tinged with the bittersweet reality of what could have been but never was.

My doodles and sketches have often been my sanctuary amidst the chaos. It's amazing how a simple sketch can bring a sense of peace and personal touch to a dull, gray cubicle.\r\n\r\nAnd sometimes, the subject of your art might just be sitting across from you, stealing glances when he thinks you're not looking.

Even a stack of paper can become a source of artistic ideas. After all, paper isn't just for reports and memos; it's a blank canvas waiting to be filled.\r\n\r\nIt's even better when you can share that sense of discovery with someone.

It's a delicate balance, though. You don't want to cross any lines, but a well-timed joke can lighten the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nLike when a certain someone put my stapler in Jello.

Falling for a coworker is complicated, and it can lead to awkward situations, or worse, heartbreak. Yet, when it's right, it feels like the most natural thing in the world.\r\n\r\nLike when you realize the person you've been sharing jokes and secret glances with is actually your soulmate.

They make the long hours bearable and add a layer of joy to the mundane. And sometimes, if you're lucky, a friendship can turn into something more—something life-changing.\r\n\r\nI've been fortunate to find that kind of friendship here.

It's a superfood, a cash crop, and a survival essential all rolled into one. Beets can be juiced, pickled, roasted, and even weaponized in a pinch.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, some people in this office (yes, Jim, I'm talking about you) fail to recognize the versatility and importance of beets. They mock what they don't understand, which is a common trait among the ignorant. I challenge anyone to a beet-eating contest to prove their worth.

The office has felt different these past few weeks, like a song that's missing its most crucial note. I never realized how much I relied on Jim's presence to make my workday bearable. From our little pranks on Dwight to our inside jokes, Jim was my sanctuary in the chaos of Dunder Mifflin.\r\n\r\nI knew he had his reasons for leaving, and as much as it hurt, I understood. But understanding doesn't make the empty desk across from me any easier to bear. It's like a constant reminder of what's missing—of who's missing. I find myself glancing over, half-expecting to lock eyes with him or share a knowing smile, but all I see are vacant chair and unused office supplies.\r\n\r\nMy sketches and doodles have lost their vibrancy, and even art, my usual escape, feels like a struggle. I've caught myself retracing the lines of an old sketch I made of him. It's not the same as having him here, but it's a small piece of a time that felt fuller, happier. A time I took for granted.\r\n\r\nI don't know what the future holds, for the office or for me. I miss my friend, my confidant, the person who made everyday moments feel extraordinary. But life moves on, and so must I. I can only hope that wherever Jim is, he's found the happiness he was seeking, even if that means it's without me.

They encourage laziness, decrease productivity, and are a blatant disrespect to the sacred institution of work. A true professional should be ready for action at all times, and that includes their attire.\r\n\r\nI tried to introduce Formal Fridays, where employees would dress in their finest attire to instill a sense of discipline and respect for the workplace. Unfortunately, this suggestion was met with mockery, further proving the decline of workplace professionalism.		U	public	f	the-flaws-in-casual-fridays	\N	0	18	\N	5

A well-trained staff is a more effective staff.\r\n\r\nJim may think it's all a joke, but who'll be laughing when a crisis arises, and he doesn't know the first thing about Krav Maga?

That's why I've devised a series of efficiency protocols to streamline office operations.

And yes, that includes office civilization. Take the Dundies, for example. While some may see it as a frivolous event, I see it as a vital ceremony that recognizes excellence and builds team morale.\r\n\r\nCritics of tradition often fail to understand its deeper value. Traditions aren't just rituals; they are a shared language that unites us. Even if that unity involves begrudgingly accepting a 'Bushiest Beaver' Dundie.

However, understanding the enemy is crucial for defense. A good prank, according to Jim's playbook, involves creativity, surprise, and a touch of humiliation.\r\n\r\nBut what do pranks really achieve? Momentary laughter at the cost of long-term productivity. While Jim is busy planning his next juvenile escapade, I'm making sales and contributing to the success of Dunder Mifflin.

That's why I recently took it upon myself to meet privately with Jan Levinson, our esteemed corporate executive, to discuss the future of the Scranton branch. While some might consider this an act of betrayal against Michael, our Regional Manager, I see it as a strategic maneuver to safeguard the interests of Dunder Mifflin.\r\n\r\nLet's be clear; loyalty is important. I have always been, and will always be, loyal to this branch and its success. However, there are times when one must take bold steps to ensure that success. My meeting with Jan was precisely one of those bold steps. As the Assistant Regional Manager, it is my duty to explore all avenues for improvement and growth, even if it means going behind Michael's back, for the greater good, of course.\r\n\r\nNow, I know that Jim and his gang of sycophants might find this controversial. They'll likely mock my commitment to the job and say that I've overstepped my boundaries. But those are the voices of people who don't understand the weight of responsibility. Great leaders like myself understand that sometimes you have to make difficult decisions, decisions that others might not agree with or understand.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, my covert meeting with Jan was not an act of rebellion but an act of strategic foresight. While the immediate fallout may be a bit uncomfortable (Michael was, understandably, not pleased), I stand by my actions. After all, in the game of paper sales, you're either a wolf or a sheep. And I, Dwight K. Schrute, am most definitely a wolf.		U	public	f	the-covert-operation-with-jan-levinson	\N	0	18	\N	5

Now, I know I usually keep things light and fun, but today I need to talk about something serious—betrayal. You see, a cornerstone of Dunder Mifflin Scranton has recently crumbled. Jim Halpert, my right-hand man, the Timon to my Pumbaa, has transferred to another branch. And the worst part? I can't help but feel like it's my fault.\r\n\r\nI've always considered myself the life of the office party, the glue that holds this wacky family together. But Jim leaving has made me question that. Was I not entertaining enough? Was my management style too avant-garde for him? I thought we had something special, a dynamic duo of comedy and paper sales. I even gave him the treasured 'Best Dad-Gummed Salesman' Dundie Award, for crying out loud!\r\n\r\nIt's hard not to take this personally. When someone leaves your branch, it feels like a slap in the face, a direct critique of your leadership. I've been racking my brain, trying to figure out what I did to drive Jim away. Was it the "Product Recall" fiasco? Or maybe the time I accidentally hit Meredith with my car? I don't know, and that's what hurts the most.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to fill the Jim-sized hole in the office or my heart. But I'll try, for the sake of Dunder Mifflin and the hard-working, amazing people who are still here. Maybe Jim will realize he made a huge mistake and come back. Or maybe this is an opportunity for me to grow as a boss and as a person. Either way, the show must go on, even if it's with a heavy heart and one less star in the cast.
